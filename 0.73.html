    <h3>TextMate-Minimap version 0.73 release notes</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Fixes issue 24: The minimap is now cropped horizontally just as the textview is. This way, a single, very long line
    cannot blur the minimap anymore.</li>
    <li>Fixes issue 25: Hitting Cmd-G or Shift-Cmd-G for finding the next occurance of a search term will update the minimap to show
    the new location.</li>
    <li>Restores compatibility with the most up-to-date forked version of ProjectPlus.</li>
    <li>Various small fixes.</li>
    </ul>
