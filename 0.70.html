	<h3>TextMate-Minimap version 0.7 release notes</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Improved minimap <b>scrolling performance</b></li>
	<li>Minimap can now be <b>scrolled independently</b> of the textview. Use the mouse wheel when hovering over the minimap.</li>
	<li>The minimap can now be <b>shown in a sidebar</b> instead of in a drawer. This makes it fit in for people using ProjectPlus or MissingDrawer to turn their project drawer into a sidebar.</li>
	<li>When opening the minimap, the window size will now be reduced to fit the minimap on the screen, if necessary (just like when opening the project drawer).</li>
	</ul>
