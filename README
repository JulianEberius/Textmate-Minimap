===========================

A minimap plugin for TextMate.

**Usage**
----------
Hit ^~@m to Show/Hide the minimap (analogue to ^~@d for the project drawer), or use the menu item under "View". Click anywhere on the map to go to that line. That's basically it ;-)

**Known Problems**
------------------
- There are some problems with bigger documents. On my late 2008 MacBook it runs fine with documents of <1000 lines, which is ok for my editing needs (as we know, classes shouldn't get that big anyway ^^)
I'm sure there are a lot of unexplored ways to make it faster, such as more drawing in the background, and incremental drawing etc... 
Maybe I can incorporate some of them in the future.

- Sometimes there could be a small misalignment of the scrollbar of the textview and the minimap. If it occurs, just activate and deactivate Soft Wrap to fix it.
