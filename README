===========================

A minimap plugin for TextMate.

Screenshots and more info can be found at http://julianeberius.github.com/Textmate-Minimap/.

**Usage**
----------
Hit ^~@m to Show/Hide the minimap (analogue to ^~@d for the project drawer), or use the menu item under "View". Click anywhere on the map to go to that line. That's basically it ;-)

**Known Problems**
------------------
- Scrolling big documents will get a bit slower, because the minimap is redrawn in parallel. Not a severe problem, but noticeable.
- Sometimes there could be a small misalignment of the scrollbar of the textview and the minimap. If it occurs, just activate and deactivate Soft Wrap to fix it.
- No working on OSX < 10.5. Sorry, Tiger users!
