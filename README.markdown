Screenshots and up to date info can be found at http://julianeberius.github.com/Textmate-Minimap/.

**Usage**
----------
Hit ^~@m to Show/Hide the minimap (analogue to ^~@d for the project drawer), or use the menu item under "View". Click anywhere on the map to go to that line. 
**Update**: Starting with version 0.7, you will be able to  scroll the minimap independently of the textview, using the scroll wheel of your mouse when hovering over the minimap. 
Also, there will be huge performance improvements, making scrolling the minimap actually fun (and productive!)
If you want to help test these new features, download the alpha from http://github.com/JulianEberius/Textmate-Minimap/downloads !.

Preferences can be found as an additional tab in TextMate's preferences. The individual options are explained in their respective tooltips.

That's basically it ;-)
