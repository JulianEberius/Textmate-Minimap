**Textmate-Minimap Plugin**
===========================

A minimap plugin for TextMate.

except for files that contain their own licenses (JRSwizzle, Sparkle, ShortcutRecorder and KFSplitView)

Screenshots and up to date info can be found at the project's [GitHub page](http://julianeberius.github.com/Textmate-Minimap/).

**Usage**
----------
Hit ^~@m to Show/Hide the minimap (analogue to ^~@d for the project drawer), or use the menu item under "View". Click anywhere on the map to go to that line. 
**Update**: Starting with version 0.7, you can scroll the minimap independently of the textview, using the scroll wheel of your mouse when hovering over the minimap. 
Scroll performance has increased, making scrolling the minimap actually fun (and productive!)

Preferences can be found as an additional tab in TextMate's preferences. The individual options are explained in their respective tooltips.

That's basically it ;-)
